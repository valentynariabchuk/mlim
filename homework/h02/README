# Tree-based models (Homework 2.3)

In this folder we'll implement a simple solution to homework 2, part 3.


## Pipeline

The pipelibe includes the following steps:
1. Build data 
1. Produce baseline results
1. Train the boosted tree model
1. Benchmark the results


## Environment variables

Set the following environment variables before running the pipeline:

| Variable    | Desription                      | Example          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `PATH_REPO` | path of the repository          | `$HOME/mlim`     |
| `PATH_ENV`  | path of the virtual environment | `$HOME/env-mlim` |

See file `ENVIR`.
